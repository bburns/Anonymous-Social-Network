UML designs

asn.mdl is for Rational Rose 
  it includes the association classes

asn.png is a screenshot of the model. need to cut it down and print to pdf. 

asn.uml and asn.umlclass are for eclipse uml2 tools
  install uml2 tools by getting updates from http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo
  and checking uml2 tools under models
  [only managed to get it working on my laptop, not on any of the cs windows machines -
   the update always failed]

yuml.txt is for www.yuml.me
  works, but can't do association classes with it
